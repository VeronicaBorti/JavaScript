## Introduction

I designed an application that works as a counter and allows the user to increment and decrement the value of the counter.

The user, upon entering the page, will display 0 as the counter value and will have two +/- buttons to change the counter value.

## Creation

The +/- buttons and counter value were realized by manipulating the DOM with JavaScript.

Subsequently, the function was implemented to make the counter value add and decrease. 

## Languages used:

<ul>
  <li>HTML </li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
</ul>
