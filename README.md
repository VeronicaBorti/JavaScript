# JavaScript Counter 

I designed an application that works as a counter and allows the user to increment and decrement the value of the counter.

The user, upon entering the page, will display 0 as the counter value and will have two +/- buttons to change the counter value.

Languages used:

-HTML 
-CSS
-JAVASCRIPT
